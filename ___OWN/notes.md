Hi Joshua. So here goes...

I looked around and at how the GPT framework can improve things on the website and came up with the following features...

# Admin Back-end
A flexible admin settings page and menu that *scales* well. The possibilities are endless. I decided to start basic. We give customers a friendly bot that can be customized to personal taste that can:
1. Fetch a customer's order and help them remove and add items then completes the sale.

This is what we have in includes/seedbot-chatbot-processing.php

        $response_data = json_decode($response, true);

        // Extract the chatbot's reply from the response and return it
        $chatbot_reply = isset($response_data['choices'][0]['text'])
            ? $response_data['choices'][0]['text']
            : 'Chatbot encountered an issue.';

        echo $chatbot_reply;

It gives responses that look like this.

 == [15:34:00] <Weasel> a1sherlappa: ok lanski <Weasel> thats a great idea ial+ <Weasel> how about you do that <We0

 can we get more meaningful responses?

 can i get something today? I just bought 50bop data.
