Yes, the **updated code** looks **correct** and **should work as intended**. 
>> You have properly localized the AJAX URL and added the correct API endpoint URL in your JavaScript file. This should allow you to test the API connection using the "Test API Connection" button in your WordPress admin settings.

Just **make sure** that your /**API key is correctly entered** and that you have replaced the **placeholder API endpoint URL** (`'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions'`) with the actual URL of the OpenAI API endpoint you want to test against.

Once you've added this code to your plugin files and activated the plugin, you should be able to test the API connection from the WordPress admin settings. If you encounter any issues, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist further.

If your API key is showing that it has been accessed today, it indicates that the key has been used to make requests to the OpenAI API. However, the "API connection failed" error you are encountering might be related to how your plugin is attempting to communicate with the API, rather than the validity of the key itself.

Here are a few steps you can take to further troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check API Endpoint**: Ensure that the API endpoint URL (`$api_url`) you are using in your plugin is correct. Double-check with OpenAI's documentation to make sure you are using the right endpoint.

2. **CORS Issues**: If you are testing the connection from a local development environment, you might encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. To test the API connection, consider doing it from a live server instead.

3. **Console Logs**: Add more console logs in your JavaScript code to debug the issue. You can log the `apiKey` and `apiEndpoint` variables to ensure they are being correctly read from the form.

4. **AJAX Action Hook**: Double-check that the AJAX action hook (`seedbot_test_api_connection`) is correctly registered in WordPress and matches the one used in your JavaScript.

5. **API Key Scope**: Ensure that your API key has the necessary permissions to access the specific endpoint you are testing. Different OpenAI endpoints may require different permissions.

6. **Server Environment**: Verify that your server environment allows outgoing requests to external APIs. Firewalls or security settings could prevent the requests from being sent.

7. **API Key Format**: Check that the API key is correctly formatted and doesn't contain any extra spaces or characters.

8. **WordPress AJAX URL**: Make sure you are using the correct WordPress AJAX URL (`ajaxurl`) in your JavaScript.

9. **Error Handling**: If the API request is failing, use the `errorThrown` parameter in your AJAX error function to capture more details about the error.

10. **OpenAI Support**: If all else fails, consider reaching out to OpenAI's support for assistance. They may be able to provide insights into why the connection is failing even though your API key appears to have been accessed.

By systematically going through these steps and testing different scenarios, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the "API connection failed" message.
